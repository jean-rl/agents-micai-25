# AI Agents using Small Language Models - MICAI 2025

Welcome to the repository of the tutorial. We're happy to have you here!

Here we've packed a small collection of resources to help you get started with building AI agents using small language models. The repository is structured as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Contains all the Jupyter notebooks used in the tutorial.
- `utils/`: Here you'll find the `llama-server` binary, the inference engine you'll need if you decide to run the notebooks in Google Colab, as it was compiled for T3 instances.
- `papers/`: A collection of relevant papers and articles that provide deeper insights into the topics covered in the tutorial.
- `slides/`: The slide deck used during the tutorial presentation.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jean-rl/agents-micai-25.git
cd agents-micai-25
```

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can find the requirements in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Installation

If you plan to run the notebooks locally, ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed. You can set up a virtual environment and install the required packages using uv:

The inference engine you'll need to download depends if you opt to run the notebooks in Google Colab or locally. If you choose to run them locally, please refer to the instructions in the `colab_agents.ipynb` notebook for downloading and setting up the `llama-server` binary. Otherwise, you must download [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) depending on your operating system. 

## LM Studio Setup

1. Download and install LM Studio from [here](https://lmstudio.ai/).
